# WebGL Signed Distance Function Mesher

Extract an STL from a glsl distance function

http://tdhooper.github.io/glsl-marching-cubes/

## Limitations

* Large meshes will be saved in parts, you can re-combine them [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net)
* You might get some missing triangles (holes) in the mesh

If you have a Mac, check out [F3](http://www.syedrezaali.com/f3-mac-app/) which does this a LOT better.

## Tools used

* [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
* [stack.gl](http://stack.gl/)
* [TWGL](http://twgljs.org/)
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/)
* [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/)

## How does it work?

It follows the basic marching cubes algorithm, except distances for each cube vertex are extracted from the shader first<sup>1</sup>, to reduce the number of GPU/CPU round trips.

The volume to be marched is subdivided into blocks small enough to fit the maximum texture size. As distances are extracted first, any blocks which are entirely inside (negative) or outside (positive) the surface are skipped, saving some time for models with a lot of empty space.

I tried running the entire marching cubes algorithm on the GPU, but the cost and difficulty of getting data back onto the CPU made it far too slow.

The JavaScript marching cubes implementation this is based on<sup>2</sup> runs much faster for simple models. I havenâ€™t compared them for more complex models.
